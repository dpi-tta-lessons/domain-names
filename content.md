# Choosing a Domain Name

<!-- TODO: swap out example -->
By now, you've built and deployed your own personal website — something that might look [like this](https://heratyian.github.io).

Take a look at the URL of your site. For example: `https://dev.to/`.  
The part of the URL between `https://` and the first `/` is called the **domain name**.

## Anatomy of a URL

(from [MDN: What is a URL?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL))

A domain name is made up of several parts:

### 🔹 Top-Level Domain (TLD)

This is the part at the end of the domain.

- `www.example.com` → TLD: `.com`
- `en.wikipedia.org` → TLD: `.org`
- `dev.to` → TLD: `.to`

### 🔹 Primary Domain

This comes immediately before the TLD.

- `www.example.com` → Primary domain: `example`
- `en.wikipedia.org` → Primary domain: `wikipedia`
- `dev.to` → Primary domain: `dev`

### 🔹 Subdomain

Anything before the primary domain is considered a subdomain.

- `www.example.com` → Subdomain: `www`
- `en.wikipedia.org` → Subdomain: `en`
- `dev.to` → No subdomain — this is called an **apex domain** (just the root domain).

## What Domain Do You Want?

When you publish your personal website or final project, you get to decide what domain it lives at.

### 💸 How Much Does a Domain Cost?

- A typical `.com` domain costs around **$10/year**.
- Some TLDs cost more — for example, `.ai` domains are around **$70/year**.
- Newer TLDs like `.dev` can be a good alternative, especially for personal tech projects, and often have more availability.

> 💡 If a domain is already owned, buying it from the current owner can be expensive — sometimes thousands of dollars. For now, focus on names that are still available for registration.
