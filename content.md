# Choosing a Domain Name

Choose and register a domain name for your personal website or final project using a domain registrar.

## Why This Matters

Every professional website needs a memorable, easy-to-share address. In this lesson, you‚Äôll explore how domain names work, how much they cost, and how to find one that fits your project ‚Äî so you can publish your site at a real URL like `https://dev.to`.

## Anatomy of a URL

Take a look at the URL of your site. For example: `https://dev.to/`.  
The part of the URL between `https://` and the first `/` is called the **domain name**.

(from [MDN: What is a URL?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL))

A domain name is made up of several parts:

### üîπ Top-Level Domain (TLD)

This is the part at the end of the domain.

- `www.example.com` ‚Üí TLD: `.com`
- `en.wikipedia.org` ‚Üí TLD: `.org`
- `dev.to` ‚Üí TLD: `.to`

### üîπ Primary Domain

This comes immediately before the TLD.

- `www.example.com` ‚Üí Primary domain: `example`
- `en.wikipedia.org` ‚Üí Primary domain: `wikipedia`
- `dev.to` ‚Üí Primary domain: `dev`

### üîπ Subdomain

Anything before the primary domain is considered a subdomain.

- `www.example.com` ‚Üí Subdomain: `www`
- `en.wikipedia.org` ‚Üí Subdomain: `en`
- `dev.to` ‚Üí No subdomain ‚Äî this is called an **apex domain** (just the root domain).

## What Domain Do You Want?

When you publish your personal website or final project, you get to decide what domain it lives at.

### üí∏ How Much Does a Domain Cost?

- A typical `.com` domain costs around **$10/year**.
- Some TLDs cost more ‚Äî for example, `.ai` domains are around **$70/year**.
- Newer TLDs like `.dev` can be a good alternative, especially for personal tech projects, and often have more availability.

> üí° If a domain is already owned, buying it from the current owner can be expensive ‚Äî sometimes thousands of dollars. For now, focus on names that are still available for registration.

### Finding Domain Ideas

- [Instant Domain Search](https://instantdomainsearch.com)

- [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com)
- [gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net)
